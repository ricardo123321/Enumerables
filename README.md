# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerables & Testing Your Ruby Code - Enumerable


This is a Ruby project to demonstrate the diferent Enumarables methods using the following methods:

1 - each
2 - any?
3 - select
4 - inject
5 - each_with_index
6 - all?
7 - none?
8 - count
9 - map

# Enumerables

This methods takes and input and returns the same result as the original methods they are based on.

# Intention of this code

This diferent methods where created with the intend to have a better understanding of the methods that are available on Ruby. Yield and call command has been used inside the methods definition to achieve this.

# Testing with Rspec

In the Ruby Code Testing - Numerous Methods project, we've added specifications for each of the many methods we've created before.
Positive and negative scenarios for the tests were taken into account, by describing different escenarios in wich we already know the answer we where able to determinate the efectiveness of our code by trying to get the same results with our code that the ones we where expected.

# Run tests
To start testing from the console, call: rspec spec\enumerable_spec.rb
